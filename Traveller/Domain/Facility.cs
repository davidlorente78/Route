        //Toilets: There are toilets to the left hand side as you enter onto Platform 1
        //Food: A coffee and drinks stand at the right hand side far end of Platform 1. If you go out of the station on the other side of the road is small road with lots of food stalls and cheap small restaurants.If you turn left from the station and cross the road there is a 7-Eleven convenience store about 80 metres down the road.The food stalls outside the 7-Eleven serve a fairly good plate of chicken and rice or bowl of noodle soup.
        //Cargo Services: As you enter the station the Freight & Parcels Office is about half way up the left hand side of Platform 1. There is no requirement to travel with cargo on the same train or any train in Thailand and you simply pick it up from the train station of your choice the same day or the next day depending on when the train arrives.
        //Transporting Bicycles from Ayutthaya train station: You can transport bicycles on trains from Ayutthaya train station if the train has a cargo car. Some trains do, others do not.Unlike other forms of cargo, in Thailand you need to load and unload bicycles yourself which means you need to travel on the same train.To purchase a ticket for a bicycle go to the Freight & Parcel Office at Ayutthaya train station after you have purchased your own train ticket. Keep the ticket for the bicycle safe as you will need to show the ticket at your destination in order to collect your bicycle.For more information see our Guide to Carrying Bicycles on Thailand Trains.
