        //Please enter your Check-in and Check-out dates

        //The rooms are big at 30 sqm and well appointed with the facilities you would expect from a 4 star hotel. The view over the river is good and the bar can become lively in the evening (the guests are often here at the expense of their companies) although the sound insulation is good at this hotel so you can sleep well.
